    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Hydrographs of a river or a stream is important hydrological information that describe the time series of discharge at a specific location. However, it is challenging to obtain field measurements of stream discharges over time. To obtain indirect measurements, USGS monitors the stream stages which can be used to calculate discharges through a rating curve method that is developed for that specific stream. In this lab module, we will examine the field data at a stream to develop the rating curve.\n",
