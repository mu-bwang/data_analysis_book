    "# Water quality modeling - BOD in rivers (II)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "We have shown in [BOD in rivers (I)](BOD1.md) that Streeter-Phelps equation explains how DO concentration varies in steady-state rivers controlled by deoxygenation, reaeration, and advection due to river flow. However, Streeter-Phelps equation does not consider other mixing processes (e.g., dispersion), so that the upstream water are not affected by the point source pollution. Apparently this is not true in reality. In this lab, we will explore this additional mixing process and how they affect DO and BOD in the stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## BOD-DO deficit equations\n",
    "\n",
    "The advection-diffusion process of DO and BOD variation is controlled by a set of partial differential equations (PDE), which can be simplified to be a set of second-order ordinary differential equations (ODE):\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: gov1\n",
    "E\\frac{d^2 L}{dx^2} - u\\frac{dL}{dx} - k_d L = 0\n",
    "```\n",

    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: gov2\n",
    "E\\frac{d^2 D}{dx^2} - u\\frac{dD}{dx} - k_a D + K_d L = 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "where $E$ is longitudinal dispersion coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other important parameters in this system include: river discharge $Q$, mass discharge in wastewater (pollutant source) $W$, BOD concentration at the source $L_0$. They are connected through this equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: L0\n",
    "L_0 = \\frac{W}{Qm_1}\n",

    "## Solving BOD equation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's work on an example of wastewater BOD discharge into a coastal plain estuary (Example 6.7 in Book \"Environmental Modeling: fate and transport of pollutants in water, air, and soil\" authored by Dr. Jerald L. Schnoor).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the list of parameters:\n",
    "* $E$ = 15 mi$^2$/day (dispersion coefficient)\n",
    "* $k_d$ = 0.15 /day (deoxygenation rate)\n",
    "* $k_a$ = 0.18 /day (reaeration rate)\n",
    "* $u$ = 3.57 mi/day (mean tidal velocity)\n",
    "* $W/Q$ = 18.5 mg/L (wastewater mass discharge / flow discharge)\n",
    "\n",
    "To find out the relationship between BOD concentration and location ($L$ vs. $x$) at both upstream and downstream of the source ($-10$ mi $< x < 50$ mi), we will need to solve Eq. {eq}`gov1` with the following boundary condition:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "L = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "\t0 & \\textrm{for } x=-\\infty \\\\\n",
    "  L_0 & \\textrm{for } x=0 \\\\\n",
    "  0 & \\textrm{for } x=\\infty\n",
    "  \\end{cases}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use `scipy.integrate.solve_bvp` to solve this boundary value problem (BVP). Here we have some incomplete instructions to get it started. However, you still need to google it to find out how to use `solve_bvp`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have a second-order ODE Eq. {eq}`gov1` for $L$, we can rewrite the second-order ODE to two first-order ODEs:\n",
