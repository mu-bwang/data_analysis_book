# About the book

This book is designed for students who take the course 'Data Analysis in Water Resource Engineering' at the University of Missouri.
In this book, we will use a series of hands-on 'laboratory module' for students (users) to explore various water resource engineering problems and to analyze theoretical equations and real-world data.
